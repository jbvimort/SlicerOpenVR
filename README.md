Building steps
--------------

- Clone Slicer from https://github.com/jbvimort/Slicer/tree/VR and checkout [VR](https://github.com/jbvimort/Slicer/tree/VR) branch

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/jbvimort/Slicer -b VR
   ```

- Build Slicer using a script similar to this one: https://gist.github.com/jbvimort/903f626b27587a2a137293da0d0cf5e0 (take care to modify the path to adapt it to your environment)

- Build the extension against the newly built Slicer

- To start Slicer from a build tree and ensure the extension is properly loaded, considering using the ``--launcher-additional-settings`` option:

   ```
   ./Slicer.exe  --launcher-additional-settings C:\path\to\SlicerOpenVR-build\inner-build\AdditionalLauncherSettings.ini --additional-module-paths C:\path\to\SlicerOpenVR-build\inner-build\
   ```

Note that specifying the top-level build directory of the extension ensures that Slicer find all types of modules.
